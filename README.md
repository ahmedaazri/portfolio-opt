# Portfolio Optimization & Visualization Tool

This repository contains a **portfolio optimization and visualization tool** designed to help investors and fund managers improve how they allocate investments across different assets (e.g., stocks, bonds, etc.).

## What is Portfolio Optimization?

Portfolio optimization is a technique used in finance to help investors make the best possible investment decisions. The goal is to maximize returns while minimizing risks, which involves carefully choosing how much money to invest in each asset (like different stocks or bonds).

## How This Tool Works

This tool allows users to:
- **Train models on historical data:** You can use past data (such as stock prices) to teach the tool how to optimize investment choices.
- **Test performance:** After the model is trained, you can test how well the optimized portfolio would have performed during a specific period in the past.
- **Benchmark comparison:** You can compare the results of your optimized portfolio with other standard portfolios, like those based on popular stock market indexes.
- **Data visualizations:** The tool provides charts and graphs to make it easy to understand how your portfolio performed, highlighting key information like the balance between risk and return.
